- **JSON**: Data parsing and handling

### Functionality

#### 1. File Upload System
- **Supported formats**: `.fna`, `.fna`, `.fas`, `.fa`, `.fasta`, `.json`, `.jsonl`
- **Multi-file support**: Can handle multiple files simultaneously
- **Robust parsing**: Handles various FASTA formats and data structures

#### 2. Sequence Processing Functions
- `parse_fasta_content()`: Parses FASTA files and extracts sequences
- `parse_jsonl_content()`: Processes JSONL (JSON Lines) files
- `parse_json_content()`: Handles JSON data structures

#### 3. ViennaRNA Analysis
- `run_viennarna_on_sequences()`: Predicts secondary structures for FASTA sequences
- `run_viennarna_on_jsonl()`: Processes sequences from JSONL files
- `run_viennarna_on_json()`: Analyzes sequences from JSON data

#### 4. Interactive Widget
- **File upload widget**: Drag-and-drop interface for multiple file types
- **Real-time processing**: Immediate feedback during file processing
- **Results display**: Shows sequence information, secondary structures, and minimum free energy (MFE)

### Working Mechanism
1. User uploads RNA sequence files through the interactive widget
2. Files are parsed based on their format (FASTA, JSON, JSONL)
3. ViennaRNA's `RNA.fold()` function predicts secondary structures
4. Results include:
   - Sequence identifier
   - Original sequence
   - Predicted secondary structure (dot-bracket notation)
   - Minimum free energy (MFE) in kcal/mol

### Output Example
```
> sequence_name
  Seq: AUGCAUGCAUGC
  Struct: (((...)))
  MFE: -2.5
```

## 2. dnachisel.ipynb - DNA Sequence Optimization Tool

### Purpose
The dnachisel notebook focuses on DNA sequence optimization using the DNAChisel library. It provides tools for uploading DNA sequences and optimizing them based on various constraints and objectives.

### Key Tools and Dependencies
- **DNAChisel**: Primary library for DNA sequence optimization

#### 2. Sequence Optimization Engine
- **Constraint-based optimization**: Applies biological constraints to sequences
- **Objective-driven optimization**: Optimizes sequences for specific goals
- **Translation-aware**: Considers protein coding sequences

#### 3. Optimization Constraints
- `AvoidPattern("GGTCTC")`: Avoids specific restriction enzyme sites
- `AvoidPattern("GAGACC")`: Prevents another restriction site
- `EnforceGCContent(mini=0.4, maxi=0.6)`: Maintains optimal GC content (40-60%)

#### 4. Optimization Objectives
- `EnforceTranslation()`: Ensures proper protein translation (for coding sequences)
- `MaximizeCAI(species="e_coli")`: Maximizes Codon Adaptation Index for E. coli

### Working Mechanism
1. User uploads DNA sequence files through the widget interface
2. Sequences are parsed and stored in memory
3. User selects a specific sequence for optimization
4. DNAChisel creates an optimization problem with:
   - Input sequence
   - Biological constraints
   - Optimization objectives (if applicable)
5. The solver resolves constraints and optimizes the sequence
6. Results show:
   - Original sequence
   - Optimized sequence
   - Similarity percentage
   - GC content comparison

### Key Features
- **Interactive selection**: Dropdown menu for sequence selection
- **Constraint resolution**: Automatically resolves conflicting constraints
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Balances multiple optimization goals
- **Sequence validation**: Ensures biological feasibility
